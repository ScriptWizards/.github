# ScriptWizards

An organization made by gamedev for gamedevs.

Here, we host the source code of our 2D game library, [the SmallGameLibrary](https://scriptwizards.github.io/documentation), and the source code of our games!

Keep an eye out, we might make some repositories public when we are ready ðŸ˜‰
